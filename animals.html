            <h2>Black Bear</h2>
            <p>The American black bear (Ursus americanus), also called simply a black bear or sometimes a baribal, 
              is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America.  
              It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. 
              American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. 
              They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of food, 
              and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food.</p>

                <p>Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits,  
                  are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also contains the hares) of the order Lagomorpha (which also contains the pikas). 
                  Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit. 
                  Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, 
                  among them the seven types of cottontail. 
                  The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, 
                  is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet.</p>

                    <p>A lynx is any of the four species (the Canada lynx, Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx, or bobcat) within the medium-sized wild cat genus Lynx.  
                      The name lynx originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word λύγξ,
                      derived from the Indo-European root leuk- ('light, brightness') in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes.</p>

                          s a hoofed mammal endemic to mountainous areas of western North America. 
                          A subalpine to alpine species, it is a sure-footed climber commonly seen on cliffs and ice.
                          Despite its vernacular name and both genera being in the same subfamily (Caprinae), the mountain goat is not a member of Capra, 
                          the genus that includes all other goats, such as the wild goat (Capra aegagrus), from which the domestic goat is derived. 
                          Instead, it is more closely allied with the takins (Budorcas) and chamois (Rupicapra).</p>

                            <p>Kingfishers are a family, the Alcedinidae, of small to medium-sized, 
                              brightly colored birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, 
                              with most species found in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Oceania, but also can be seen in Europe. 
                              They can be found in deep forests near calm ponds and small rivers. 
                              The family contains 114 species and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera. 
                              All kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. 
                              Most species have bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes. 
                              Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests.</p>

                                <p>Porcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp spines, or quills, 
                                  that protect them against predation. The term covers two families of animals: the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae, 
                                  and the New World porcupines of family, Erethizontidae. 
                                  Both families belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of rigid or semi-rigid quills, 
                                  which are modified hairs composed of keratin. Despite this, the two groups are distinct from one another and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi. 
                                  The largest species of porcupine is the third-largest living rodent in the world, after the capybara and beaver.</p>

                                       Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, 
                                       breeding mostly on the tundra. It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle,

                                       it is the only owl with mainly white plumage. Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to more have more extensive flecks of dark brown.</p>
